nonhierarchical competition between species has been proposed as a potential mechanism for biodiversity maintenance, but theoretical and empirical research has thus far concentrated on systems composed of relatively few species.

Extracts on Simulation:
 Simulations of the dynamics for the tournament. The simulation begins with 25,000 individuals assigned to species at random (with equal probability per species). At each time step, we pick two individuals at random and allow the superior to replace the individual of the inferior. We repeat these competitions 10^7 time

our model thus far has examined tournaments in spatially uniform resource environments. To explore how spatial niches combine with intransitive competitive interactions, we simulated a system of 100 species ranked at random for five factors. The species compete in many patches, each of which is limited by a randomly assigned combination of up to five factors. All species are initially present in all patches, but due to between patch differences in the limiting factors, different tournaments arise in different patches (following the logic outlined in Fig. 2 for each patch see above).
